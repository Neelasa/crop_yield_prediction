Agriculture is a primary source of livelihood for a significant portion of the global population, and accurate crop yield prediction plays a vital role in improving food security, resource allocation, and farming efficiency. This project focuses on developing a *Crop Yield Prediction* system using *Machine Learning* techniques. The system leverages historical agricultural data, including climatic conditions, soil parameters, and crop details, to train a prediction model.

A *Decision Tree Regressor* model was implemented using *Scikit-learn, with preprocessing and scaling performed to improve prediction accuracy. The application is deployed as a **web-based interface* using *Flask*, enabling farmers and agricultural analysts to input parameters such as temperature, rainfall, area, and crop type to receive yield predictions instantly.

The solution is lightweight, user-friendly, and accessible online, making it suitable for real-time decision-making in agricultural planning. By providing timely and accurate yield forecasts, the system can assist in enhancing productivity, optimizing resource use, and reducing potential losses due to unpredictable environmental factors.
